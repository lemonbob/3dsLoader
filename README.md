# Project JEDI 3ds file loader for Direct3D (Directx9) in Delphi

This unit can be used to load and decode 3ds files into a vertex buffer for use in Direct3D.

The code is mostley assembler for ease of memory manipulation, therefore it can be easily proted to C++.

This file was used primarily before helper routines were introduced into Directx to allow 3d file formats to be imported into the D3D engine.
